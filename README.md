# Project Overview:
As part of this company’s strategic expansion into the aviation sector, the focus of this project is to identify the optimal aircraft for both commercial and private operations, with a strong emphasis on minimizing risk. The goal is to conduct a comprehensive risk analysis of various aircraft models to guide purchasing decisions for this new venture.

Given the complexity and high stakes of entering the aviation industry, this project adopts a data-driven approach to assess potential risks associated with different aircrafts. 

Key factors to be evaluated include:
  * Accident trends and causes (using historical accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board covering 1962–2023)
  * Geographical and environmental factors
  * Recommended aircraft specifications
  
The aim is to identify aircraft that offer a balanced trade-off between cost, safety, operational efficiency, and long-term profitability. The final deliverable will consist of actionable insights that will help the head of the aviation division make informed decisions about which aircraft to purchase


## Business Understanding
##### Problem Statement

The company is expanding into the aviation sector and needs to determine which aircraft models to purchase for both commercial and private operations. The key challenge is to select aircrafts that minimize financial and operational risks. This requires conducting a comprehensive risk analysis based on accident data, geographical factors, and operational costs, ensuring the chosen aircraft provide an optimal balance between cost, safety, efficiency, and profitability.

##### Research Questions/Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to provide actionable insights that help the company make informed decisions when selecting aircraft. To achieve this, we will focus on the following research questions:

* What aircraft models have the lowest accident rates based on the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) data from 1962 to 2023?
* How do geographical and environmental factors influence aircraft safety and operational performance for commercial and private operations?
* Which aircraft models offer the best trade-off between safety, cost, and long-term profitability for the company’s new aviation division?
    
##### Success Criteria
The success of this project will be measured by:

* Accuracy of Risk Analysis: The ability to accurately identify aircraft models with the lowest accident rates and the best safety records.
* Data-Driven Recommendations: Providing clear, data-driven recommendations that reduce the financial and operational risks of the aviation venture.
* Actionable Insights for Stakeholders: Delivering a comprehensive report that equips the aviation division with evidence-based decision-making tools for purchasing aircraft.
    
##### Assumptions 

The assumptions made when conducting this analysis are:

* Technological Advancements: Aircraft technology is constantly evolving, and newer models may have safety features or operational efficiencies that are not reflected in the historical data.
* Consistent Maintenance Practices: We assume that operational and maintenance practices for the aircraft selected will be consistent with industry standards, impacting the reliability and safety of the aircraft similarly to past trends.
* Operational Cost Variations: Maintenance and operational costs can fluctuate based on many factors, such as fuel price changes, labor costs, and regional regulations. These variations may impact the accuracy of the cost-benefit analysis.

##### Limitations

* There are data from early years (1962 to 1980) have very few data collected
